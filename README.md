The 32-Channel RF Signal Amplifier and Attenuator System is a modular amplifier and attenuation system designed to provide 2nd stage amplification in close proximity to an MRI scanner. With proper choice of components it can readily be adapted to a wide range of Larmor frequencies and applications. Each channelâ€™s amplifier and attenuator circuitry is  housed on a separate daughterboard for flexibility and easy servicing. These Daughterboards stand perpendicular to a larger Motherboard which contains all the common circuitry such as power distribution and protection circuitry, as well as the interface for attenuation control.
